# Number Play - implementation notes

## Game screen

Both games rely on the abstract classes
[NumberPlayGameLevel](https://github.com/phetsims/number-play/blob/main/js/game/model/NumberPlayGameLevel.ts) and
[NumberPlayGameLevelNode](https://github.com/phetsims/number-play/blob/main/js/game/view/NumberPlayGameLevelNode.ts).

The 'Counting' game builds upon the countingAreas that are used in the _Ten_, _Twenty_, and _Compare_ screens, but
doesn't include the controls for changing the object type or adding/removing objects.
[Subitizer](https://github.com/phetsims/number-play/blob/main/js/game/model/Subitizer.ts) controls the game sequence and
determines the shapes to show in the 'Subitize' game.

[NumberPlayGameAnswerButtons](https://github.com/phetsims/number-play/blob/main/js/game/view/NumberPlayGameAnswerButtons.ts)
are used in both games for the user to input their answer. A smiley face is shown when the correct answer is selected.
When an incorrect answer button is pressed, the button is disabled, and a frowny face is briefly shown.
